# ballvsAball
This repository contains a MATLAB code that visualizes the transformation of a unit ball in a chosen norm (p-norm) under a 2x2 matrix. It displays the matrix's determinant, eigenvalues, and condition number, alongside dynamic plots of the unit ball and its transformed counterpart, illustrating linear algebra concepts.
